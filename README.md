# RubhberbandShift

This is a GDExtension for Godot 4.4+ that loads in a RubberbandStretcher as an effect. Right now the usability of it is very limited, for I have only added support for preserving formants on audio.

# How to build
Make sure to build Rubberband before you try to built this. Just build it like you normally would. Same with the extension.
