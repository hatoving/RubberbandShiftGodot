# RubhberbandShiftGodot

This is a GDExtension for Godot 4.4+ that loads in a RubberbandStretcher from the Rubberband library as an effect. Right now the usability of it is very limited, for I have only added support for preserving formants on audio.

# How to build
Make sure to build Rubberband before you try to built this. Just build it like you normally would. Same with the extension. More detailed building instructions will be given; at the time I'm writing this I'm busy with a lot of things... :P
